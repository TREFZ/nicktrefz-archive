            <h1>User Interface Design</h1>
            
            <p>
                I've designed and redesigned many user interfaces.  Here are some examples of my work, and a brief description of each project.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Newssift.com</h3>
            
            <p>
                Newssift was a news aggregator web site with analysis of various metrics, such as article volume and "sentiment" or how positive and negative media sources were on a given topic.  While I was with Newssift I redesigned key pages of the site such as the search results page, and helped build previously nonexistent sections such as the user dashboard.

            <h3>TopCoder Java Applet Arena</h3>
            
            <p>
                The TopCoder Arena was a Java applet that allowed users to interface with our services, like our online programming competitions.  While its functionality has always been heralded by the community, the original design always left something to be desired.  Here are some snapshots from the project to redesign the entire interface.

            <h3>Favorites</h3>
            
            <p>
            	At TopCoder, we often gave the community the decision-making power, sometimes in the form of a popular vote.  We found that providing a UI for a well-executed vote can be tricky business.  What if you want a ranking of several favorites instead of just "pick one"?  What if the candidates are pictures, or zip archives, or anything other than a string of text?  What if the pool of candidates is large?   It was obvious that we had to design a system to give users an interface that let them focus on the vote itself, not the process of voting.  Below is a prototype that I designed for such a project.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            	The key features are a simple layout, mouseover preview windows of the candidates, a drag-n-drop interface for ranking, the ability to hold image candidates, and the ability to present a large pool of candidates.
            </p>

            <h3>TopCoder Software Tour</h3>
            
            <p>
                TopCoder's approach to software development was revolutionary, which also meant it was difficult for newcomers to grasp.  Our research showed that many people came to our site, found an abundance of information, but often left with thoughts like "I have no idea what TopCoder does" or "I didn't know that TopCoder makes software".  After researching successful in-person introductions with our sales team, I suggested we provide a "tour", a low level introduction to our process, first presenting the most basic message ("We build software.") and then gradually providing more detail on what made us different.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I molded the idea into a series of pages, then designed and coded them into a working HTML tour.
            </p>

            <h3>History/Distribution Graphs (Flash)</h3>
            
            <p>
            	TopCoder competitors earned a rating that changed each time they competed.  To complement our library of statistics, I suggested an interactive graph that mapped each competitor's rating history over the course of their career.  I gave the developers a sample XML page to use as a template for live data feeds, and let them know that if they produced the feed, I would provide the Flash to parse and visually display it.  In addition, each node on the graph would react to mouseovers by displaying information about that competition, and clicking the node would bring the user to the overall results of that competition.  The graph now rests prominently on every member's profile page. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            	I followed up that project with a distribution graph that would sort the entire community into rating "buckets" and then mark the location of a given member, to help visualize how that competitor stacked up against the rest of his peers.

            <p>
            	CashStar wanted to add the ability to insert custom images onto their digital gift cards.  They asked me to design a prototype for the project.  I wanted the process to be seamless and intuitive, a fun little feature that didn't pull you away from the existing process of building a gift card.  No page changes and no new browser windows.  I designed built the following prototype, implementing several jQuery plugins.
